    <h3>üîê Setup for signed builds</h3>
    <p>
        When creating signed builds, you need a <b>keystore</b> file and a <code>key.properties</code> file with the secrets on how to unlock the keystore.
    </p>

    <h4>Keystore file</h4>
    <p>
        To create a keystore, use Android Studio and <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#generate-key">follow the official documentation</a>. Be careful and note the values you use for keystore password, key alias, and key password -- you will use these when creating the <code>key.properties</code> file.
    </p>

    <h4>key.properties file</h4>
    <p>
        The <code>key.properties</code> file is a plain text file, and it should look like this:
        <pre>
storeFile=FILENAME_OF_KEYSTORE_YOU_CREATED
storePassword=XXXXXX
keyAlias=XXXXXX
keyPassword=XXXXXX</pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Here's a sample of a <code>key.properties</code> file. Note that the <code>storeFile</code> key <i>only has the name</i> of the store file without the path:
        <pre>
storeFile=keystore.jks
storePassword=veryStrongPassword
keyAlias=reasonableAlias
keyPassword=anotherStrongPassword</pre>
    </p>

    <h3>Storing secrets in GitHub Actions</h3>
    <p>
        GitHub Actions only supports text-based secrets; uploading files is not allowed. So you will encode your keystore file and <code>key.properties</code> file using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">Base64</a>, and add the encoded text as secrets for GitHub Actions. When the workflow is running, it will fetch the secrets from GitHub, decode them, and put the files in the correct place so that the release build is generated correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
        On macOS, run this on the command line to encode a file and copy the encoded string to your clipboard:
        <pre>base64 -i FILENAME | pbcopy</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        Then, go to the Actions Secrets of your GitHub repository (Settings > Secrets and variables (in the sidebar) > Actions), and click "New repository secret". Ensure that the name of the secret is the same name that is being used in the Actions workflow file. We're using:
        <ul>
            <li><code>KEYSTORE_BASE64</code> for the keystore file</li>
            <li><code>KEY_PROPERTIES_BASE64</code> for the key.properties file</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Reading signing data during Flutter build</h3>
    <p>
        As long as you don't change the location of the files in the generated workflow below, Flutter will automatically pick up the signing configuration and create a valid release build.
    </p>

    <h3>#Ô∏è‚É£  Dynamic app versioning</h3>
    <p>
        By using <code>workflow_dispatch</code> in GitHub Actions, you can give arguments to a workflow run. We use this to pass build version information to the Flutter build tool, which is useful if a different system, for e.g. <a href="https://github.com/tramlinehq/tramline/" target="_blank">Tramline</a>, manages versioning for you. Here's how to do it:
    </p>

    <p>
        Flutter makes it very easy to specify a build code and number during the build process. We simply use the <code>--build-code</code> and <code>--build-number</code> arguments.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can see this below in the generated workflow file.
    </p>

<h3>All done! Now you can copy the workflow ‚¨áÔ∏è</h3>
